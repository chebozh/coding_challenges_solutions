"""
Write a regular expression to match any article + noun pair. The articles are either "a/an" or "the".
Use non-capturing groups in your expression.
Example

txt = "There is an apple and a pen on the desk"
pattern = "yourregularexpressionhere"

re.findall(pattern, txt) âžž ["an apple", "a pen", "the desk"]

Notes

    You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
    Do not remove import re from the code.
    Find more info on RegEx and non-capturing groups in Resources.
